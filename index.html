This week we had to stay in a different classroom. This week I also had to take the PSAT and it was awful.The pape airplane project we made a paper airplane and the plane went like 18 meters. Today we are checking grades and making sure I have everything turned in.

This week we sketched rockets on cad and then made them out of 
materials we listed on our BOM. On our first attempt at launching it went up then fell to the ground.
On our second attempt it did the exact same thing.

This week we watched a presentation on environmental engineering. After watching he presentation
we made homemade water purifiers with coke bottlers we used for the bottle rocket project.
My teams result on the purification was good but not the best. On thursday we took a test on the 
environmetal engineering presentaion and I say I did decent on it. Later we tried finding an estimate on how many
candy corns can fit on a paper, and my team did not win.

This week we wactehd a couple of presentaions on breadboarding and how it works. We had to do a worksheet 
that had a bunch of math solving with Voltage, ohms, etc. 
After that we went onto tinkercad an made three different breadboard models. Some were hard to make like the one
with 150V but we found out that you could use a potato and set it to 150V

This week we worked with real breadboards and were trying to make LEDs light up in three different ways.
The next day we we were doing the same thing but had to record the data on paper. Today we were debating 
whether or not math class or 1,000,000 were better than each other. Our conclusion was math class was better because
we could just take kindergarten math and call it a day.
