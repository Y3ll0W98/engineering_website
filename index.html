  and created a toaster for a competition

This week we had to stay in a different classroom. This week I also had to take the PSAT and it was awful.The pape airplane project we made a paper airplane and the plane went like 18 meters. Today we are checking grades and making sure I have everything turned in.

This week we sketched rockets on cad and then made them out of 
materials we listed on our BOM. On our first attempt at launching it went up then fell to the ground.
On our second attempt it did the exact same thing.

This week we watched a presentation on environmental engineering. After watching he presentation
we made homemade water purifiers with coke bottlers we used for the bottle rocket project.
My teams result on the purification was good but not the best. On thursday we took a test on the 
environmetal engineering presentaion and I say I did decent on it. Later we tried finding an estimate on how many
candy corns can fit on a paper, and my team did not win.

This week we wactehd a couple of presentaions on breadboarding and how it works. We had to do a worksheet 
that had a bunch of math solving with Voltage, ohms, etc. 
After that we went onto tinkercad an made three different breadboard models. Some were hard to make like the one
with 150V but we found out that you could use a potato and set it to 150V

This week we worked with real breadboards and were trying to make LEDs light up in three different ways.
The next day we we were doing the same thing but had to record the data on paper. Today we were debating 
whether or not math class or 1,000,000 were better than each other. Our conclusion was math class was better because
we could just take kindergarten math and call it a day.

This week I worked on my breadboard and connected it to the arduino website
I did not need verification like other people did which was nice. We also worked on connecting the LEDs to sync
up with the code and make the LEDs flash really fast

  This week I modelled a noodle bridge on tinkercad. We managed
  to make the first prototype of the noodle bridge.
  We had some trouble keeping it held up because Niro and Elio kept bumping into it.

This week we made 3 different noodle bridge models. We made a truss bridge, a line bridge and something.
We also made tinkercad models of the bridges.

  This week we worked a lot on our third model. We also made a backup model just in case but it is very flimsy. 
  We made and finished our google slides.

  This week we made a imaginary business. Jason and I made business about making toy cars that could have
  a lot of customizations. We made up numbers and a story, and put it on a google slides

  This week I worked more on the cars 4 kids presentaions. We presented the presentation and it went well. Me and Jason 
  had gotten like 5 offers which was nice.

  This week we made oobleck. The oobleck was very fun to punch and mess around with. On wednesday we started 
  to work on a arduino car and so far we made a six page google doc for it

  This week we finished the google doc for the project. We also started the tinkercad's on the schematics and the
  cad for the car. We also made a bridge out of sticky notes and it failed.

  This week we started building our car. The car is a little tough to build considering we only have cardboard to make it.
  We are also going to start on our coding soon once we are doing making the chassis of it.
  On challege day we made a contraption thing that held a water ballon and had to go 100 meters with it without dropping it.
  I got 2nd place because for some reason I thought people weren't running but I was wrong.

  This week we started to finalize our car. We had a couple of probems with the arduino stuff. We had problems like connecting
  the rights wires and finding the right wires and which one is which. We also started to sauder the wire that connected a green 
  and a yellow wire and we had to melt metal on the motor. Today we are almost done and we put the top of the car on and finished
  the wiring.

  This week me and Jason finished the arduino code and started to plug it in. We also had two protype and one finalized back wheel.
  Our first prototype was a big lego wheel. The big wheek was working at first but it ended up being stiff and slowing down the front two 
  wheels. We also had a problem with the front wheels being weeked and used a 9 volt battery today and making it go way faster. the second protoype 
  was two lego bars but it looked like a slug. Our finalized back wheel ended up being the lego bar with two discs attached.
